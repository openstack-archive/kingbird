    Scans the backing nova database to look for table entries where

    fixed_ips table since that can contain NULL instance_uuid entries by
    design). Dumps the tables that have NULL instance_uuid entries or

    migration script to detect and optionally cleanup NULL instance_uuid
    records.

                   just query to see if they exist for reporting.
